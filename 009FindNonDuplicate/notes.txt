Problem:
Array contains one number which is not duplicate while all the others are. How do we find this one number?
**
Solution:
2 potential solutions:
    1. Iterate through array and fill the hashmap with entries (number, times_occured). Iterate through hashMap then
        and return the number which occured 1 time
            O(n) Time complexity
            O(n) Space complexity
    2. Initialize a variable to 0, and iterate through the array xoring every element along the way.
        3 xor properties: 1. num xor num = 0; 2. num xor 0 = num; 3. xor is associative.
        From 1. and 3. => 4. Xoring all number pairs will leave us with 0. From 2. and 4. => ultimately the variable
        will contain the unique number
            O(n) Time complexity
            O(1) Space complexity

Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(1) Space
