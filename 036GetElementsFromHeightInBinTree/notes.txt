Problem:
Given a binary tree, return all the values of the nodes at the given tree height/level.
**
Solution:
Using DFS or BFS recurse into the tree until node at the given height is reached.
Return the found node and combine it with the other nodes into the result.
**
Complexity:
O(n) Time   (visiting every single node)
O(n) Space  (tree could be a one parent - one child branch all the way)
