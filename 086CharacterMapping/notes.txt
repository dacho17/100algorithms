Problem:
Given are two strings.
Determine if the character mapping between these strings is 1:1.
**
Solution:
While iterating through the string1, either:
    1. Save character mappings into a dictionary
    2. Validate the mapping
If the mapping is invalid, strings do not have 1:1 mapping.
**
Complexity:
O(n) Time   (where n is length of words)
O(n) Space
