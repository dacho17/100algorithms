Problem:
We have a simple mathematical expression consisting of operators +, -, (, ), and numbers.
The expression needs to be evaluated and the result returned.
**
Solution:
Remember the multiplier of expression +, -, for ( and ) go into recursion, add numbers within each expression and pass
    them back to the calling function when exiting recursion. Also keep track of the current index.
**
Complexity:
O(n) Time
[O(n), O(1)] Space (call stack in case of the expression with many parentheses)
