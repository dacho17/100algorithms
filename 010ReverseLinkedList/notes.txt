Problem:
Reverse a linked list
**
Solution:
1. Traverse and push nodes on the stack, then pop them and link them with pointers
    O(n) Time
    O(n) Space
2. Traverse through the list and turn the pointers to point to the previous node
    O(n) Time
    O(1) Space  (if done iteratively); TODO: do it - I have a recursive solution
**
Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(1) Space
