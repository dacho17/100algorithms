Problem:
Given is a number n.
Generate all binary trees of the array [1, n].
**
Solution:
Transform the array to queue.
Iterate through the length of queue, 
Number of trees which can be constructed follows CATALAN NUMBER array. 
**
Complexity:
O(n*2^n) Time   (constructing ~ 2^n trees each taking n time to be constructed)
O(n) Space  (where n is number of nodes in the tree)
    - recursion stack can reach this, but saving the binary trees will take much more space
