Problem:
A matrix is given where the number of unique paths needs to be calculated starting from the top-left corner and ending in right-bottom corner.
Only rightwards and downwards moves are allowed. 
**
Solution:
To each field in topmost and leftmost rows we can arrive in 1 way.
Each other field can be reached by going right from the left field or going down from the upper field.
So the number of ways a field can be reached will be left field ways + upper field ways.

Complexity:
Dynamic programming approach:
    O(mxn) Time
    O(mxn) Space
