Problem:
K lists of sorted elements are given. The task is to created a sorted list of all the elements.
**
Solution:
Each iteration will contain a heap of K elements which are currently being considered for insertion.
Smallest of those elements will be inserted to the final list,
    pointer on the correct list will be increased and the next element in that list will be added to the heap.
**
Complexity:
O(nlog(K)) Time
O(n) Space
