Problem:
Given is a number.
Find the least number of squared additioners whose sum will be this number.
**
Solution:
Calculate the additioner candidate list (relevant squares) and store them in an array.
for 1 until the number provided,
    iterate through the candidate list and store the minimum number of sum steps to reach each number.
**
Complexity:
O(nsqrt(n)) Time    (where n is the given number)
O(n) Space
