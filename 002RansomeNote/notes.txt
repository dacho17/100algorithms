Problem:
The problem requires the function to be implemented, which will determine wether a given word can be spelled using characters from the list provided.
**
Solution & Complexity:
I came up with 3 possible solutions for this problem:
    1. Brute force
        - go through the word (length k) and for each character iterate the list (length n)
        - O(k*n) time
        - O(n) space
    2. Create a HashMap     (Instructor went with this approach)
        - make a map of format <letter, nOfLettersAvailable>
        - O(n) time
        - O(1) space
    3. Make a bucket array  (I think this is faster than 2. since there is no time spent on searching with arrays)
        - O(n) time
        - O(1) space
