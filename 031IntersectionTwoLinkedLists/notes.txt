Problem:
Given two complete linked lists, find the node in which they intersect. If they do intersect.
NOTE: The lists will have common nodes from the node of intersection and until the last node.
**
Solution:
Traverse both lists and find their length. Move the starting point of longer list
    len(longer) - len(shorter) nodes. Start comparing nodes from that point onwards.
    Since lists end with the common sublist, they will merge at some node.
**
Complexity:
O(m + n) Time
O(1) Space
