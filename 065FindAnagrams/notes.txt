Problem:
Find all anagrams of the given word within the given string.
**
Solution:
Use cleverly encoded sliding window to check whether the currently watched word is an anagram.
The algorithm is further described next to the implementation of the algorithm.
**
Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(2w) Space  (w is the length of the word)
