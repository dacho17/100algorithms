Problem:
A word and a 2D Matrix containing chars are given.
Reading top-bottom and left-right, does the word exist in the matrix?
**
Solution:
1. Brute force + heuristics
2. The matrix can be used as a tree also (each entry is a node pointing to down and right nodes) so DFS/BFS can be used here.
    This will require more space, but could improve time? TODO: Think about this!
**
Complexity:
O(n^2) Time
O(k) Space
