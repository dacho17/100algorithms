Problem:
List of sorted numbers is given, as well as a target number.
Find the indices of first and last occurance of the target number within the list.
**
Solution:
1. Traverse through the list (n) and store first and last occurance 
    - O(n) time complexity & O(1) space complexity (no additional memory used)
    - can we do better? - Yes we can!
2. Do a binary search which will find the element in the list in O(log(n)) time complexity
**
Complexity:
O(log(n)) Space
O(log(n)) Time
