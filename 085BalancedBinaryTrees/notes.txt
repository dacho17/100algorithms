Problem:    (NOTE: duplicate of task 037)
Determine if the binary tree is HEIGHT balanced.
*HEIGHT BALANCED:
    - the difference between the heights of the left and the right subtree for any node is not more than one
    - the left subtree is balanced
    - the right subtree is balanced
**
Solution:
Traverse all the nodes, pass the height going upwards and compare the heights of left and right subtree on every node.
**
Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(n) Space
