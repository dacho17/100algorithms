Problem:
We have an array of numbers from which Pythagorean triplets need to be found.
**
Solution:
1. Brute force - 3 nested loops O(n3)
2. Faster way
    Create a hashed set which stores the square values of the numbers. O(n) time and space
    Iterate through 2 loops and see if sum of elements gives any sum in hashed set. O(n^2) time
**
Complexity:
O(n^2) Time
O(n) Space
