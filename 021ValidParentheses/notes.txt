Problem:
A list of parentheses is given. It needs to be determined whether these parentheses are validly placed.
**
Solution:
Follow the occurances of parentheses by pushing them on the stack. They all need to be closed in the opposite of the order they were openned LIFO.
**
Complexity:
O(n) Time   - traversing through the expression
O(n) Space  - expression could be made entirely of openning parentheses which means stack can become of size n
