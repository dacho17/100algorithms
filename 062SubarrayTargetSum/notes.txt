Problem:
Given are an array and a target number.
Find the subarray whose elements sum to the target number.
**
Solution:
Target sum = curSum - prefixSum
Remember total sums at each step and save them as prefixSums.
With each new iteration check if the prefix sum exists such that substracted from current total sum gives a target sum.
In short: remember sums on each step, check if the sum on the following step minus any of the stored sums gives a target sum.

Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(n) Space
