Problem:
Given is a list of nodes. Swap every neighboring pair of nodes in the list, in a way that swap is
made for a pair and the next swap will not touch elements of that pair anymore but proceed with the following pair.
e.g. 1->2->3 2->1->3
**
Solution:
Iterate through the list and swap value for a pair. Skip over a node then and continue doing the same.
**
Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(1) Space
