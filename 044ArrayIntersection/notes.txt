Problem:
Given two arrays, find their common elements (intersection).
**
Solution:
Pass through the first list and put its elements in a set.
Pass through the second list and check its elements against the set constructed from the first list.
To the result set, insert the elements which are matched.
**
Complexity:
O(n + m) Time   (n and m are list lengths)
O(2 * max(n, m)) Space  (if all of the elements are in common)
