Problem:
Given is an nxm matrix that represents a maze.
Rules:
    0 represent fields which can be walked through.
    1 represent walls.
    Only right or down step can be taken.
    Start point is (0,0) and end point is ((n-1)x(m-1))
**
Solution:
Dynamic programming.
To each field, one can arrive in sum(neighbor_arrivals) different ways.
**
Complexity:
O(nxm) Time
O(nxm) Space
