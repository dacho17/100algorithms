Problem:
Given an array, find all triplets which summed up give 0.
**
Solution:
1. Brute force - 3 for loops. O(n^3) time complexity
2. 2sum approach where we are summing 2 numbers to give -n. (derived from a + b + n = 0)
3. Sort the array. And for each number (representing a sum) in the array, iterate through the array with two pointers (@ start & end of the array).
    If the sum of pointed elements is too great, move end pointer backwards. If the sum of pointed elements is too low, move start pointer forwards. Move pointers until end == start.
**
Complexity:
3.
    O(n^2) Time
    O(n) Space
