Problem:
Given is a list of words. Find which words can be made by concatenation of other words within the list.
**
Solution:
Sort the words based on their length. Create a trei out of those words.
When inserting a new word in the structure, check if it is a combination of already existing words.
Insert the new word in the structure, and remember the word as a concatenation combination.
Return all found concatenation combinations.

Complexity:
O((n*m) * log(n*m)) Time (sort time)
O(n*m) Space
