Problem:
The goal is to remove k-th element from the back side of a list.
**
Solution:
1. Iterate through the list and determine its length. Iterate through it again and remove the element.
2. Have two pointers in the list. Second offset by k + 1 from the other first. When the second hits the end of the list
    the node pointed to by the first pointer, will have its next property set to k-1st (from the end) member of the list.
**
Complexity:
1.
    O(n) + O(n-k) ~ O(2n) Time
    O(1) Space
2.
    O(n) Time
    O(1) Space
