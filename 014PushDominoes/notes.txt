Problem:
We get a list of elements which represent forces (R, L, or none) applied to dominos within the list.
Based on this list, we need to determine whether each domino will fall L, R, or stay still. This info needs to be output.
**
Solution:
Pass through the list rightwards, and assign right force amount influencing each domino. Do the same leftwards.
These forces must have be of opposite prefix sign. Sum up left and right force influences.
Sums equal to 0 denote that dominos will stay still, those positive will be leaning one one side and those negative to the other.
