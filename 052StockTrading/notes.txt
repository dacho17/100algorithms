Problem:
Given a list of prices, determine when was the best time to buy and sell a stock.
Return the max profit which could have been gained.
**
Solution:
Davy: the task can be solved sweeping through the array and storing max and min value. The difference between the two is the solution.
    - no it cannot because time is a factor. Min could appear after Max
Otherwise: Iterate through the prices list with a pointer to the minimum value found so far.
    If the difference between currently considered element and the minimum is negative. Current element becomes minimum.
    If the difference between currently considered element and the minimum is maximum. This is the max profit until now.

Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(1) Space
