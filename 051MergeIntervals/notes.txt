Problem:
Given a list of intervals, return the list of merged, non-overlapping intervals.
**
Solution:
Sort the list of intervals by their starting value.
Check if the starting point of the next interval falls within the current interval.
If it does, continue expanding the current interval. If it does not, store the interval and start a new one.

Complexity:
O(n * logn) Time
O(n) Space
