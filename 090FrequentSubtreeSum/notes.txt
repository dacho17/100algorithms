Problem:
Given is a binary tree.
Find the most frequent subtree sum in the tree.
**
Solution:
Have a dictionary counting the sums. Return the entry with the highest value.
**
Complexity:
O(n) Time   (one traversal through the tree and one through the dict (2n))
O(n) Space  (each node defines a subtree, each subtree could have a different sum)
