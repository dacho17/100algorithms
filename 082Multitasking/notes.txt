Problem:
Given is a job sequence in order the job need to be ran, and their cooldown time.
Calculate how long will it take for jobs to finish.
Jobs of the same kind cannot be ran in paralel.
e.g. cool = 2, [1, 1, 2, 1]
    - 1..12.1(..) => 7 time units
**
Solution:
step 1:
    1 available right away, last ran on 0
    1 available for next at 3 (1 + cooldown)
    curJob executing at 0
step 2:
    1 available at 3, last ran on 3
    1 available for next at 6 (prior + 1 + cooldown)
    curJob executing at 3
step 3:
    2 available right away, last ran on 4
    curJob executing at 4
step 4:
    1 avialble at 6, last run on 6
    1 available for next at 9 (prior + 1 + cooldown)
    curJob executing at 6
**
Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(j) Space  (dictionary size where j is a number of jobs)
