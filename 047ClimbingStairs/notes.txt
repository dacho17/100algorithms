Problem:
Given is a number n.
A person needs to move to the n-th step.
Going upwards is possible by taking either 1 or 2 steps at the time.
What is the number of possible combinations in which a person can climb to the n-th stair.
**
Solution:
This is a Fibonacci sequence. f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
**
Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(1) Space
