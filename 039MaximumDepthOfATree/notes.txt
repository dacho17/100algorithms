Problem:
Find the maximum depth of a binary tree.
**
Solution:
Iterative form must be used due to the large size of the tree.
Push the visited nodes, along with their depth on the stack.
**
Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(n) Space  (in case right nodes appear on every subtree and remain unpopped on stack (n/2))
