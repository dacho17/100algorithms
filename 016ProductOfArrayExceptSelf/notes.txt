Problem:
Given an array of integers, construct a new array prod such that prod[i] is equal to the product of all the elements
    of the initial array except the element on index i. The solution must not use division operator.
**
Solution:
Create 2 arrays from the given one. One will be constructed leftwards, and the other one rightwards.
    Each element will be the total product of elements traversed up to that element.

Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(n) Space
