Problem:
Given are a phone number and a list of valid words.
Return all the valid words which can be generated using the phone number buttons.
**
Solution:
Preprocess the valid words.
Encode them to their phone number combination and store in a dictionary in format (encodedVal, [words]).
Fetching words for a given combinations is done in O(1).
**
Complexity:
O(n) Time   (to encode the valid words it will take O(26 * n) where 26n is the summed length of words)
O(n) Space
