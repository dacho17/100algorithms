Problem:
Find the depth of a binary tree.
**
Solution:
In each recursive call check if the current node is a leaf, if yes start incrementing depth by one with each return.
For the non-leaf nodes, determine which of their subtrees has the longest depth.
**
Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(log(n)) Space (the depth of the fully balanced tree approaches the value of log(n))
