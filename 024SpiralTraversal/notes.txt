Problem:
A mxn matrix is given which needs to be traversed spirally.
**
Solution:
Initialize the edges. Visit elements in order: right, down, left, each direction until the edge is hit.
When horizontal or vertical edges become other side's edge, terminate the execution.
**
Complexity:
O(mxn) Time
O(1) Space
