Problem:
Given is a list. Remove the sequential duplicate element in the list.
**
Solution:
Iterate through the list and if the curent value is equal to previous, connect prev node to the next node.
NOTE: to support removing duplicates in general, hashset can be used to track seen elements -> O(n) space complexity
**
Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(1) Space
