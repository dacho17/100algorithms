Problem:
Array of people is given where each person is defined with format (height, n), where n represents
    the number of the people in front of the person who are of the same height or higher.
The array is unordered and needs to be ordered with respect to the definition of the entry.
"Queue of these people needs to be reconstructed."
**
Solution:
Sort first by height descending, and then by n ascending.
This way we will first place in the list highest people with the least obstacles, and then shorter ones around them.
We will insert new people to the list to the index n (that will exactly be a number of higher people then).
**
Complexity:
O(n^2) Time
O(n) Space

TODO: can this be done better? Some bucket algorithm!?
