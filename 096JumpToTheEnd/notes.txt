Problem:
Given is an array of numbers where each element represents an amount of jumps which can be performed in within the round.
What is the minimum number of rounds required to jump to the last element of the array?
**
Solution:
h[i] = h[j] + 1, where:
    - h[i] is the amount of rounds necessary to reach index i, and
    - h[j] is the amount of rounds necessary to reach index j
Count the minimal number of rounds necessary to reach each of the indices.

Complexity:
O(n^2) Time TODO: check if time complexity can be cut down!?
O(n) Space
