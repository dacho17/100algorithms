Problem:
Given a tree and a subtree, determine whether the subtree is the subtree of the tree.
**
Solution:
DFS Traverse the first tree and for rach node either continue the existing comparison, or do the comparisson anew.
**
Complexity:
O(n * m) Time   (for each node in tree we check if it is a root of a subtree)
O(n) Space    ()
