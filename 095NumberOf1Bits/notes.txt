Problem:
Given is a decimal number. Return the number of 1 bits which appear in the binary representation of that number.
**
Solution:
While number is not 0, check if the digit considered is 1 and divide it by 2 by shifting bits.
**
Complexity:
O(n) Time   (n is a number of binary digits)
O(1) Space
