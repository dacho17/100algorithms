Problem:
We are given a list of points where subsequent pairs represent vector edges. The task is to determine whether moving
    up to one point in the list can make all the vectors in the list inclining.
**
Solution:
After all possible combinations of 3 vectors have been analyzed and patterns recognized, the evaluation rules have been
    derived.
    There can be no 2 declining vectors in the list, since they cannot be resolved by moving one point.
    There are edge cases for starting and ending vector, where the starting/ending point are being moved.
    Otherwise, if possible move the starting point of the declining vector so that its value lies between the values of prev
    and next point. If this is not possible, the list cannot be inclining.

Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(1) Space
