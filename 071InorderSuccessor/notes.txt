Problem:
Given are a binary search tree and a node.
Return the node which holds a successor to the value of the given node.
**
Solution:
Iterate through the child successors, if any, of the target node.
Find the leftmost node in the right subtree (successors) of the target node - this will be the first successor to the target node.
    - value range of all the nodes in the tree is determined by the currentNode's first right and left parents [rightPar, leftPar]
If no child successors exist for the node, climb the parents and find the first left parent (larger parent).
**
Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(1) Space
