Problem:
Given a binary tree, print its elements in a zig-zag motion.
**
Solution:
Have two stacks which will store nodes to be printed.
Each stack stores nodes from the same level, so stack 1 will store nodes from the current and stack 2 nodes from the level bellow.
To stack 1 push the nodes from leftmost sibling towards rightmost.
To stack 2 push the nodes from rightmost sibling towards leftmost.
**
Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(n) Space
