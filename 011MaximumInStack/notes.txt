Problem:
Create a data structure such that the maximum value of the stack is easily accessible
**
Solution:
1. First thing that comes to mind is iterating through a stack and finding the max.
    (No additional space and O(n) time)
2. If we are optimizing for the time, as we are since the maximum needs to be easily accessible, we can create an additional
    stack which stores maximum values for the initial stack. Here the space complexity is an additional n, but the time
    complexity is O(1).

Complexity:
O(1) Time
O(n) Space
