Problem:
This problem requires a validation function to be implemented for binary trees.
The requirement of the validation function is that node values on the right side of the tree
    must be larger than node values on the left side of the tree.
**
Solution:
Traverse nodes recursively, set low threshold when visiting right node, set high threshold when visiting left node
Make sure that visited nodes are within given thresholds
**
Complexity:
Solution is done in:
    O(n) Time
    O(n) Space
