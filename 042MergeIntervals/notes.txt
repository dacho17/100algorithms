Problem:
Given a sorted array of numbers
**
Solution:
Pass once through the array and check if the current array is alive, if not save it and reset the current array.
If yes increase the pointer and change the expected values. 
**
Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(n) Space  (2n worst case where array is entirely made of 1-element subarrays)
