Problem:
Given an array, find the length of the longest increasing (not necessarily connected) subsequence in the array.
**
Solution:
Keep track of all increasing subarray lengths and their maximums.
Store these in dictionary.
With each iteration refresh the dictionary.
**
Complexity:
O(n^2) Time
O(n) Space
